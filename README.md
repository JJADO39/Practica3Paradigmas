# Description of the project
This project implements a program that can read and analyze FEN Strings, a format used to represent the state of a chess board, via a graphic interface where the user can put his FEN Strings and verify it with a button.

If the FEN String is not written correctly, or any of the other chess rules are broken the program can show the mistake in a error message below the screen, but if its valid the program shows the whole chess board with it respective pieces and positions.

# Language used

The project was made in Java, using the swing extension to create the interface
